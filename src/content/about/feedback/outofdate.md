You can submit an edit for a zone from either the map view (click on a zoning district and then select "Submit an edit" and the bottom of the popup) or from the table view (click the <i class="fas fa-edit icon" style="content: '\f044'; color: #00613F;"></i> icon in the leftmost column of the appropriate row). Both methods will lead you to the same form, which will be sent to our Zoning Atlas team for vetting and potential inclusion.
