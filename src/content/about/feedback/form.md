You do not need to complete every field in order to propose an edit; simply fill in the fields relevant to your edit. If your edit does not fit into any of the fields, you may include it in the General Comments section at the bottom of the form. You do need to fill out your name and email address with each form submission, though, in the event that we need to contact you for further clarification.
