MAPC's multi-year review of municipal zoning yielded many observations about the nature of land use regulation in the region. Many of these observations are consistent with those articulated by Amy Dain in her review of multifamily zoning. One clear conclusion is that zoning codes in Metro Boston are dizzyingly complex. Each city and town writes its own zoning according to its own rules and system. This makes interpreting them across municipalities very challenging. Whether one is a developer, advocate, or regional planner, understanding what is permitted where and under what circumstances is an arduous task.
