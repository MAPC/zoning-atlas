<h3 class="report-section__subtitle">C. Publishing and Reporting</h3>

Not only should zoning data be maintained in an electronic format, but it should also be made available to the public with the same access and regularity as the bylaws or ordinances. Once current spatial data is available, it should be published as a downloadable dataset, interactive web viewer, and/or API. This will enable all users and stakeholders to access accurate data from any location, creating more data transparency and resiliency.

Our efforts found that achieving that level of transparency may require a cultural and bureaucratic change in some municipalities that have official policies or effective practices that limit public access to zoning data. Legal guidance and, if necessary, intervention from state officials may be necessary to shift these attitudes.

Along with publishing data locally, there is a need for a regular process to contribute zoning updates to a central repository such as the Zoning Atlas. While cities and towns are statutorily required to notify regional planning agencies of proposed zoning changes, the notifications provide little information and are provided by only a small minority of municipalities. Towns must submit approved zoning changes to the Attorney General for review, but district boundaries are not part of that submittal, much less in electronic format.
