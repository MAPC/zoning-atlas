Planning Boards can adopt a policy to create and maintain a GIS representation of the zoning district boundaries that can serve as the definitive legal version of the municipalityâ€™s district boundaries. At the very least, GIS data should be consistent and contemporaneous with the published zoning bylaw or ordinance.

MAPC or another lead agency can support this effort by convening a stakeholder group (municipalities, state agencies, GIS consultants, industry and advocacy organizations) to establish and maintain a data standard for spatial zoning data. This data standard would specify particular fields, data formats, levels of accuracy, and other parameters for storing electronic forms of zoning district boundaries. (The standardization of zoning codes is another matter entirely and is addressed elsewhere in our recommendations.)

The Commonwealth should provide financial support for MassGIS, RPAs, or consultants to provide technical assistance to municipalities that need to get their data to a current and maintainable state consistent with the established spatial data standard. The support could be modeled off the Level 3 Parcel initiative, which ensured that all municipal parcel and assessor data met minimum format and quality standards. As with parcels, the Commonwealth can also provide strong incentives to encourage municipalities to keep that data current.

MAPC along with other RPAs and partner organizations should further investigate the state of practice with regard to zoning data maintenance and the use of consultants. This information can inform a collective procurement process that would provide municipalities with qualified, cost-effective technical assistance for zoning data maintenance.
