All these complexities demonstrate that the task of precisely determining what uses are permitted in a given zone and at what intensity is difficult, if not impossible.

For the purposes of our Zoning Atlas, therefore, MAPC defined a basic set of “core fields” covering use allowances and dimensional requirements and set out to collect that information from the zoning codes. Those core fields are as follows:

1. Minimum lot size
2. Dwelling units allowed per acre
3. Maximum height
4. Maximum floor-area-ratio (FAR) · Whether multifamily housing was a permitted use, and if a special permit was required

For ordinances and bylaws that regulate development using different use and intensity metrics, we had to estimate the desired value based on other fields available in the code. In some cases, we even had to estimate the fields we used to calculate our core fields. (The details of this process are included in the technical appendix.) Where there were multiple uses or intensities allowed, our approach was to code districts according to the densest use allowable without a special permit, in order to provide an ‘upper bound’ estimate of by-right development potential.

The challenges of interpreting overlay districts, especially those that permit greater flexibility and increased density, is even more complex than the task for base zoning. These districts often include even more requirements and discretionary review processes that tend to obscure, rather than define, the likely development potential on a given site. MAPC has not yet attempted to interpret or standardize the allowable uses and densities in these districts. For now, we have settled on classifying them into three types:

1. Flexible Districts, which generally relax the density and dimensional requirements of the underlying zone. Examples include overlay zones that allow multifamily housing or mixed-use development in places where it is not permitted, or that permit flexibility in site design.
2. Restrictive Districts, which limit development potential so as to protect natural resources or other assets. Examples include floodplain overlay districts and historical preservation districts
3. Special Districts, which have targeted application to specific, often legally mandated uses. Examples include telecommunications or adult-use districts.

This point bears repeating: by no means is the Zoning Atlas a definitive and comprehensive representation of precisely what development allowed in a given zone. Indeed, it is not clear that any such definitive representation is even possible, given the complexities we have described above. The full significance of zoning can only be determined as a project moves its way through the regulatory process and is evaluated by regulatory boards. Instead, the Atlas aspires to be a generalized interpretation of the zoning code which is comparable across municipal boundaries and amenable to updates and improvements over time. In other words, if we got it totally wrong, let us know!
