Development patterns also influence how often and how far people drive. When zoning encourages growth in cities, town centers, and around transit, the resulting residents and workers are more likely to walk, bike and take transit, so they have a lower carbon footprint and contribute less to auto congestion. Of course, no one municipality can stop climate change, so municipalities must work together to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change, just as regions and nations must collaborate to address this global challenge.

Coordination across city and town boundaries is essential, but can only be analyzed if zoning and land use policies can be compared across multiple municipalities.

In 2019 the Massachusetts Smart Growth Alliance published <a href="https://ma-smartgrowth.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/03/FINAL_Multi-Family_Housing_Report.pdf" class="report-section__link">The State of Zoning for Multifamily Housing in Greater Boston</a>, in which researcher Amy Dain explored ways that municipalities in the region do or do not allow for development of multifamily housing in their zoning regulations. While it may seem, to someone not familiar with the intricacies of municipal zoning in Massachusetts, that it should be straightforward to understand whether a municipality does or does not allow for multifamily housing, the reality is quite different. Dain’s research finds that although all but one of <span class="footnote">100 municipalities<sup class="superscript">1<span class="tooltip">Dain did not include Boston in her analysis because it is already producing a tremendous amount of new housing, and because Boston operates under a completely different zoning statute from the rest of Massachusetts.</span></sup></span> in the region technically allow for multifamily housing, density restrictions, dimensional regulations, permitting requirements, discretionary permits, and other barriers are so arduous that it makes building multifamily housing very hard, if not impossible in most communities.

Her research also finds some common trends with respect to allowances for multifamily housing in recent years. In the last decade or so, more municipalities are allowing for mixed-use development in their town centers, and more density around transit station areas; more are adding flexibility into their regulations that allow developers to build multifamily buildings through discretionary permitting processes. She also found evidence that many suburban municipalities are encouraging or allowing multifamily housing at scale in marginal areas at the periphery of the community, rather than in established areas or near town centers or transit. Furthermore, she found that many municipalities are adding political layers of approval for individual projects, even when zoning technically allows that project in a particular site.

Dain’s research shed light on the myriad challenges the region faces in building the amount of housing it needs. She highlighted the layers of complexity in the zoning codes and processes that municipalities enforce.

MAPC’s Zoning Atlas adds a critical resource to the conversation: an electronic zoning database that can not only map the boundaries of the nearly two thousand zoning districts in the region along with their allowable uses, but also accept updates and improvements from municipal staff so it will evolve over time. The data in this atlas can be used by municipal staff to understand how their zoning compares to that of their neighbors, by researchers to begin to answer questions about development in the region, by MAPC to help us understand where and how much development may happen in the future, and by advocates to shed light on municipalities in the region that hold onto exclusionary restrictions.

It is our hope that the zoning data we have collected, standardized, and made available are used for all of these purposes and more. It is also our hope that the municipal staff who steward their own official zoning boundaries and codes will help us keep this atlas as current and accurate as possible. Our findings and observations should also serve as a call to action for those interested in transparent, efficient governance, as there is much that could be done to improve access and comparability of zoning data.
