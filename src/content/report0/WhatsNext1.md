The Zoning Atlas will always be a work in progress. The initial release is admittedly incomplete and likely inaccurate in places. Yet it is an essential framework that can be filled in and refined over time to create a more complete representation of the region’s land use controls. MAPC will dedicate resources to maintaining the data and web portal, and will also continue to collect and incorporate new and better data, contingent on available funding. MAPC is also harvesting the Zoning Atlas for insight about municipal zoning policies. In 2021, we will be releasing a series of report examining regional patterns in multifamily housing policies, commercial development capacity, and zoning around tranist stations.

The Atlas is also designed to accept additions and corrections from users: the broader community of municipal staff and other knowledgeable stakeholders can contribute to its improvement. There is a mechanism for users to correct erroneous values, add missing information, and provide data about new or missing districts. MAPC will validate all submissions before incorporating them into the Atlas. In this way, a community of users can help to complete and maintain the work, with MAPC as a lead and steward.

MAPC will also work to enhance the Atlas itself to make it a more useful resource. We hope to receive feedback about how to improve the dataset or about features that might make the online publication more robust and useful. Improvements might include additional data fields or descriptors, changes in the data structure, information about discretionary processes, or the addition of contextual layers on the map, such as transit station areas, environmental justice populations, data on new developments, and more. We can’t promise new features right away, but we appreciate feedback as we make decisions about how to update and maintain the site.

Of course, the contents of the Atlas will need to be updated over time. Zoning boundaries and regulations evolve. Municipalities update their zoning. As we have discussed, there is no comprehensive reporting mechanism for municipalities to share their zoning information with a state or regional database. Our goal is that MAPC’s Zoning Atlas can, at least until there is a statewide policy, serve as that central repository. However, it should not serve that purpose indefinitely.

There are many practical and efficient steps that could be taken to improve the consistency and availability of zoning data across the region. Over the coming years, MAPC will be working with member municipalities, stakeholders, and legislatures to advance state and local actions toward that goal.
