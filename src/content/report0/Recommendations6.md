In the interest of transparency and informed engagement, municipalities should publish the GIS version of their zoning boundaries online, in a format accessible to viewers and users. The ideal would be for every municipality to make it available as an interactive map on their website that could be explored, with a download and/or API option so that stakeholders may access it as a public resource. The published data should be accompanied by metadata specifying its origin, including the corresponding ordinance or bylaw.

MAPC or other partner organizations should research and develop guidance on the legal obligation to make zoning data available as a public record. This guidance could also examine whether and how electronic records can be designated as the official district boundaries.

State agencies can designate an official repository for electronic zoning data—whether the Zoning Atlas or another data storage option—and could incentivize or even require municipalities to provide updated files when zoning district boundary changes are adopted.
