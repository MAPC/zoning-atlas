In the interest of transparency and informed engagement, municipalities should publish the GIS version of their zoning boundaries online, in a format accessible to viewers and users. The ideal would be for every municipality to make this information available as an interactive map that could be explored on their website, with a download and/or API option so that stakeholders may access as a public resource. The published data should be accompanied by metadata specifying its origin, including the corresponding ordinance or bylaw.

MAPC or other partner organizations should research and develop guidance on the legal obligation to make zoning data available as a public record. This guidance could also examine whether and how electronic records can be designated as the official district boundaries.

State agencies can designate an official repository for electronic zoning data—whether the Zoning Atlas or another data storage option—and could incentivize or even require municipalities to provide updated files when zoning district boundary changes are adopted.

Provision of zoning changes to RPAs should be encouraged and, if need be, enforced. This would enable RPAs to keep track of and update zoning information throughout their regions, enabling more effective tracking and comparison of municipal codes, as well as the sharing of best practices.
