Zoning is the DNA of a community's land use. It doesn't determine everything, but it's an underlying, coded blueprint for change, or sometimes the lack thereof. It affects a community's housing options, climate resilience, economy, public health, equity, transportation, emissions, and more.

Of course, these issues transcend local borders. In this sense, a city or town's zoning not only shapes the municipality's own future, but also that of its neighbors, and its neighbors' neighbors. For that reason, Greater Boston's larger challenges demand an understanding of land use regulations on a regional basis.

Yet the zoning codes of the 101 cities and towns of Greater Boston's are so complex, varied, hard to access, and bewildering that the only available regional data is decades old and incomplete.

MAPC's Zoning Atlas, a resource nine years in the making, is the first regional zoning map since 1999 and the first to include information about multifamily housing, residential density, commercial density, and overlay districts. Even more important, it is being published as a dynamic online resource that will improve over time as municipal staff and other contributors refine the data and provide updates. The public launch of the Zoning Atlas marks not the conclusion of the project, but the beginning of an initiative to build a comprehensive, community-driven inventory of land use regulations in Massachusetts.
