Massachusetts cities and towns have broad authority to regulate how property owners can use their land, and the requirements set forth in zoning codes have a profound influence on how communities change over time. While a municipality’s zoning is not necessarily determinative of the development that is going to happen—there are many other influencing factors such as septic capacity, heath and building codes, and the subjectivity of municipal officials in how zoning regulations are applied—it is the most basic expression of the community's policies (and values) regarding land use and development.
