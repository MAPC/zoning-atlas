Massachusetts cities and towns have broad authority to regulate how property owners can use their land, and the requirements set forth in zoning codes have a profound influence on how communities change over time. While a municipality’s zoning is not necessarily determinative of the development that is going to happen—there are many other influencing factors, such as septic capacity, heath and building codes, and the subjective application of zoning regulations across municipalities—it is the most basic expression of the community's policies (and values) regarding land use and development.

It is also clear that changing land use regulations must be part of the solution for meeting the region’s most urgent challenges: housing insecurity, greenhouse gas emissions, climate change vulnerability, and a struggling transportation system. Metro Boston has one of the tightest housing markets in the country, partly because so few municipalities have zoning that expressly permits multifamily housing. Meanwhile, municipalities that restrict multifamily development, or even denser development of single-family homes on small lots, remain exclusionary by race and unaffordable by income.
