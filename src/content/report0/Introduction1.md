Massachusetts cities and towns have broad authority to regulate how property owners can use their land, and the requirements set forth in zoning codes have a profound influence on how communities change over time. While a municipality's zoning is not necessarily determinative of the development that is going to happen—there are many other influencing factors, such as septic capacity, heath and building codes, and the vagaries of discretionary approvals—it is the most basic expression of the community's policies (and values) regarding land use and development.

It is also clear that changing land use regulations must be part of the solution for meeting the region's most urgent challenges: housing insecurity, residential segregation and inequity, greenhouse gas emissions, climate change vulnerability, and a struggling transportation system. Metro Boston has one of the tightest housing markets in the country, partly because so few municipalities have zoning that expressly permits multifamily housing. Meanwhile, municipalities that restrict multifamily development, or even denser development of single-family homes on small lots, remain exclusionary by race and unaffordable by income. The impacts of those choices reverberate well outside the boundaries of those communities, putting increased pressure on existing housing stock throughout the region.

Development patterns also influence how often and how far people drive. When zoning encourages growth in cities, town centers, and around transit, the resulting residents and workers are more likely to walk, bike and take transit, so they have a lower carbon footprint and contribute less to auto congestion. Of course, no one municipality can stop climate change, so municipalities must work together to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change, just as regions and nations must collaborate to address this global challenge.
