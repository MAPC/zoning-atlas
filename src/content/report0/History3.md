As described later in this report, we propose that a long-term goal should be for all municipalities in Massachusetts to move toward standardized reporting of zoning requirements, changes, and decisions to a central data intermediary, such as MassGIS. This will take the guesswork and abstraction out of MAPCâ€™s efforts, will allow for comprehensive analysis of zoning in the state, will streamline the work of municipal staff in their zoning update or reform efforts, and will inherently streamline the overly complex nature of the zoning codes themselves, thus helping to streamline and make more transparent the development process.
