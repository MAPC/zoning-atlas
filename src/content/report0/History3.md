The Atlas will also improve as attributes and interpretations are refined by stakeholders. Because the restrictions of a zoning code are contingent on both site conditions and interpretation, there is often no definitive value for a particular metric. As a result, the attribute values in the Atlas represent only an *approximation* of how complex bylaws and ordinances are likely to be applied. Where our interpretations are incorrect, stakeholder contributions will be critical to building a robust and accurate database.
