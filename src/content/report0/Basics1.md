There are two distinct elements to municipal zoning. First is the zoning map that defines the geographic extent and physical boundaries of the zoning districts; second are the municipality’s zoning bylaws or ordinances that detail, in narrative form, the allowable uses, dimensional restrictions, design requirements, and other regulatory aspects of each district.

There are also two different types of districts: base zoning districts and overlay districts. Base zoning districts cover the entirety of a municipality without overlapping each other. Overlay districts, as their name suggests, overlap base zoning districts (and sometimes each other) to add further detail to or change regulatory specifics of the underlying districts. Overlay districts don’t have to cover the entirety of a municipality, and in fact, some municipalities don’t have any overlay districts at all. Some overlay districts provide more flexibility in development or allow higher density; others restrict development in a particular area to protect valued resources; and some are narrowly targeted districts for specific uses such as telecommunications or adult uses.

Zoning also speaks to what landowners may do with their property without official review, and what they can only do at the discretion of a deciding authority.

Kinds of uses and intensities of uses that don’t require further review are referred to as “by right,” or “as of right” uses. Pursuing a project allowed by right in a particular zone is the most straightforward pathway for development, as long as the proposal is strictly consistent with the zoning requirements.

On the other hand, discretionary processes take many forms. They may add considerable complexity to a development process, while also ensuring the municipality has more control over a particular proposal. Special permits have to be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory body (the Special Permit Granting Authority, or SPGA) in the municipality. This may be the planning board, the zoning board of appeals, the city council, or another designated municipal entity.

Special permits may be required for a particular use or dimensional flexibility within a zone, or they could apply to all development of a certain type or in a specified overlay district. However, property rights law requires that zoning must permit some economically viable use of each parcel on a nondiscretionary basis. In other words, for every parcel and base zone, there must be some form of allowable development that does not require a discretionary permit.

In addition to the complexity inherent in zoning bylaws and ordinances themselves, there are often logistical barrier and planning and permitting processes that further restrict what is built.

Such procedural mechanisms are many. For example, regulatory requirements, such as state wastewater disposal regulations, the Wetlands Protection Act, or local wastewater or wetland regulations may preclude a site from being developed to the maximum amount permitted by zoning. Or a town without extensive septic networks may have to limit density due to a lack of capacity for wastewater disposal. Or mitigation requirements or community benefits agreements may render higher density developments financially infeasible.

Discretionary processes may allow a municipality to reject a proposal otherwise largely consistent with the zoning code. The result is that what is built on the ground does not always reflect the written policy in the zoning bylaws or ordinances. As a result, even in districts where zoning nominally allows multifamily development, it is often rare due to the obstacles presented by other regulatory factors.
