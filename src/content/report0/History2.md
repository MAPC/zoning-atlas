TThe data were also used to develop 'buildout' analyses that estimated the total number of units that could be built on undeveloped areas under base zoning. Since that 1999 release, the need for regional zoning data has arisen in MAPC’s work numerous times and has been requested by municipalities and other organizations with whom we collaborate.

A regional zoning map was one of the ten "Most Wanted Datasets" MAPC identified in *MetroFuture: Making a Greater Boston Region*, Metro Boston’s 2008 regional plan. As an agency in a unique position to serve as a data intermediary for the 101 municipalities in our region, and that has the capacity to take on a large regional dataset collection and publication project, MAPC took on the project in 2011.

At the outset, it was clear that the Atlas should not only update the 1999 zoning map, but should include additional features, including interpretation of multifamily housing restrictions, overlay districts, online interactive mapping, and mechanisms for feedback and updates. In order to inform the data collection and design the data format itself, MAPC consulted an advisory group consisting of municipal planners, state agency staff, and other stakeholders. The input from this advisory group was used to define a data schema and guidelines for interpreting local codes.

MAPC began the data collection in 2012, but the work was hampered by municipal nonresponse as described below, and the task of compiling spatial district boundaries and interpreting the bylaws proved to be much more complex than anticipated. Due to budgetary restrictions, MAPC was able to dedicate staff to the project only on an episodic basis in the subsequent years, and the data collection proceeded slowly. The launch of MAPC’s current regional planning effort *MetroCommon 2050* created the opportunity to renew work on the zoning data collection and complete the first iteration of the Atlas.

The Zoning Atlas will always be a work in progress. Its first release in December 2020 is a foundational dataset that can be updated and improved over time and with the contributions of municipal staff and other stakeholders. Municipal zoning boundaries and codes are living documents, and it is our intention that the Zoning Atlas will evolve as municipalities update their zoning.
