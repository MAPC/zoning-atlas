<h3 class="report-section__subtitle">B. Municipal Data Management</h3>

There is a wide range when it comes to the capacity of each municipality in Greater Boston to develop, manage, and update electronic versions of their zoning maps. There is also a wide range of political and policy commitment toward that effort. After all, it does demand some resources. GIS data management requires training that not every municipal staff person has, and time that all municipal staff are short on. Yet zoning is fundamental to the fabric of a municipality, just like roads and pipes, all of which are mapped and inventoried. For many municipalities, zoning data does not yet exist in an updatable electronic format. These cities and towns will need assistance to bring their zoning up to a standard where it can be maintained efficiently over time. Even more municipalities will benefit from support for maintenance of the data, through incentives or reduced-price consultant assistance.
