Zoning ordinances and bylaws have a similarly wide variety of formats and access pathways. Some municipalities publish their zoning bylaws or ordinances as PDFs on their websites (sometimes machine-readable, sometimes scanned), and others use a web platform designed for publishing municipal codes, such as <a href="https://www.generalcode.com/subscription-services/" class="report-section__link">eCode360</a> or <a href="https://www.municode.com/" class="report-section__link">municode</a>. One municipality publishes their codes as a Word document. While some of these formats make data interpretation and extraction for a third-party such as MAPC easier than others, the many variations in form, not to mention content, slowed down our collection process.
