The last time there was a coordinated effort to compile and standardize municipal zoning data in Massachusetts was in 1999, when the Massachusetts Bureau of Geographic Information (MassGIS) created a statewide GIS map of so-called 'base zoning' and compiled information from the bylaws or ordinances of each municipality in the state (with the exception of Boston). MassGIS standardized information from the codes to allow for comparison across municipalities and to provide a regional overview of allowed uses.
