It is no surprise, with all the complexities that we encountered in creating this Zoning Atlas, that it has taken two decades for any state or regional entity to collect and publish a multi-municipal collection of zoning information. There are a number of ways that we propose this process could be made more efficient, but each of them requires the coordinated efforts of each municipality in the region. For a resource as important to the future of Greater Boston as zoning regulations, we hope that municipalities are open to updating their methods where appropriate with the following recommendations.

<h3 class="report-section__subtitle">A. Improving and maintaining the Zoning Atlas</h3>

Until a statewide standard for publishing and reporting zoning information exists, MAPC is committed to maintaining the Zoning Atlas, and, to the best of our ability, incorporating the stakeholder feedback that we receive. In the spirit of transparency, data stewardship, and municipal collaboration, we hope that our municipal partners throughout the region will find the Zoning Atlas a useful resource and will help us to keep it as true to form as possible by submitting their feedback and data updates.
