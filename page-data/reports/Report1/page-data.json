While a municipality's zoning is not necessarily determinative of the development that is going to happen—there are many other influencing factors, such as septic capacity, health and building codes, and the vagaries of discretionary approvals—it is the most basic expression of the community's policies (and values) regarding land use and development.</p>\n<p>It is also clear that changing land use regulations must be part of the solution for meeting the region's most urgent challenges: housing insecurity, residential segregation and inequity, greenhouse gas emissions, climate change vulnerability, and a struggling transportation system. Metro Boston has one of the tightest housing markets in the country, partly because so few municipalities have zoning that expressly permits multifamily housing. Meanwhile, municipalities that restrict multifamily development, or even denser development of single-family homes on small lots, remain exclusionary by race and unaffordable by income. The impacts of those choices reverberate well outside the boundaries of those communities, putting increased pressure on existing housing stock throughout the region.</p>\n<p>Development patterns also influence how often and how far people drive. When zoning encourages growth in cities, town centers, and around transit, the resulting residents and workers are more likely to walk, bike and take transit, so they have a lower carbon footprint and contribute less to auto congestion.

While it may seem, to someone not familiar with the intricacies of municipal zoning in Massachusetts, that it should be straightforward to understand whether a municipality does or does not allow for multifamily housing, the reality is quite different. Dain's research finds that although all but one of <span class=\"footnote\">100 municipalities<sup class=\"superscript\">1<span class=\"tooltip\">Dain did not include Boston in her analysis because it is already producing a tremendous amount of new housing, and because Boston operates under a completely different zoning statute from the rest of Massachusetts.</span></sup></span> in the region technically allow for multifamily housing, density restrictions, dimensional regulations, permitting requirements, discretionary permits, and other barriers are so arduous that it makes building multifamily housing very hard, if not impossible in most communities.</p>\n<p>Dain's research also finds some common trends with respect to allowances for multifamily housing in recent years. In the last decade or so, more municipalities are allowing for modest amounts of mixed-use development in their town centers and around transit station areas; more are adding flexibility into their regulations that allow developers to build multifamily buildings through discretionary permitting processes. She also found evidence that many suburban municipalities are allowing and in some cases encouraging substantial amounts of multifamily housing in marginal areas at the periphery of the community, rather than in established areas or near town centers or transit. Furthermore, she found that municipalities are increasingly using discretionary review procedures (such as special permits or 'floating zones') for multifamily development, adding barriers that don't exist when zoning spell out clearly what is and is not allowed at a particular site.</p>\n<p>Dain's research shed light on the myriad challenges the region faces in building the amount of housing it needs. She also highlighted the layers of complexity in the zoning codes and regulatory review processes required by municipalities. Her work raises critical questions not only about the extent to which cities and towns are making efforts to meet housing demand, but also whether they are taking active steps to address the racist and classist history of redlining and exclusionary zoning policies designed to keep out less-wealthy residents and people of color. In short, it appears that few communities are doing so, but the full picture has not been drawn.</p>\n<p>MAPC's Zoning Atlas adds a critical resource to the conversation: an electronic zoning database that can not only map the boundaries of the nearly 2,000 zoning districts in the region along with their allowable uses, but also accept updates and improvements from municipal staff so it will evolve over time. The data in this atlas can be used by municipal staff to understand how their zoning compares to that of their neighbors, by researchers to begin to answer questions about development in the region, by MAPC to create more accurate land use projections to guide infrastructure investment, and by advocates to shed light on municipalities in the region that hold onto exclusionary restrictions.</p>\n<p>It is our hope that the zoning data we have collected, standardized, and made available are used for all of these purposes and more.

First is the zoning map that defines the geographic extent and precise boundaries of the zoning districts; second are the municipality's zoning bylaws (for towns) or ordinances (for cities) that detail, in narrative form, the allowable uses, dimensional restrictions, design requirements, and other regulatory aspects of each district.</p>\n<p>There are also two different types of districts: base zoning districts and overlay districts. Base zoning districts cover the entirety of a municipality without overlapping each other. Overlay districts, as their name suggests, overlap base zoning districts (and sometimes each other) to add further detail to or change regulatory specifics of the underlying districts. Overlay districts don't have to cover the entirety of a municipality, and in fact, some municipalities don't have any overlay districts at all. Some overlay districts provide more flexibility in development or allow higher density; others restrict development in a particular area to protect valued environmental or cultural resources; and some are narrowly targeted districts for specific uses, such as telecommunications or adult uses.</p>\n<p>Zoning also speaks to what landowners may do with their property without official review, and what they can only do at the discretion of a deciding authority. Kinds of uses and intensities of uses that don't require further review are referred to as \"by right\" or \"as of right\" uses. Pursuing a project allowed by right in a particular zone is the most straightforward pathway for development, as long as the proposal is strictly consistent with the zoning requirements. A proposal that conforms to the zoning code can generally proceed directly to the application for a building permit without needing approval from a planning board or other regulatory body.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, discretionary processes take many forms and create many opportunities for a proposal to be blocked, sometimes permanently. They may add considerable complexity to a development process, while also ensuring the municipality has more control over a particular proposal. Special permits have to be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory body (the Special Permit Granting Authority, or SPGA) in the municipality. This may be the planning board, the zoning board of appeals, the city council, or another designated municipal entity.</p>\n<p>Special permits may be required for a particular use or dimensional flexibility within a zone, or they could apply to all development of a certain type or in a specified overlay district. However, property rights law requires that zoning must permit some economically viable use of each parcel on a nondiscretionary basis. In other words, for every parcel and base zone, there must be some form of allowable development that does not require a discretionary permit.</p>\n<p>In addition to the complexity inherent in zoning bylaws and ordinances themselves, there are often logistical barriers and planning and permitting processes that further restrict what is built. Such procedural mechanisms are many. For example, regulatory requirements, such as state wastewater disposal regulations, the Wetlands Protection Act, or local wastewater or wetland regulations may preclude a site from being developed to the maximum amount permitted by zoning. Or mitigation requirements or community benefits agreements may render higher density developments financially infeasible.</p>\n<p>Discretionary processes may allow a municipality to reject a proposal otherwise largely consistent with the zoning code. The result is that what is built on the ground does not always reflect the written policy in the zoning bylaws or ordinances. As a result, even in districts where zoning nominally allows multifamily development, it is often rare due to the obstacles presented by other regulatory factors.</p>","id":"d139eb6e-a64a-5f58-b99d-0f21137b9449","frontmatter":{"page":"report1","section":"basics-of-massachusetts-zoning","title":"The Basics of Massachusetts Zoning","order":4,"toc":true,"credit":null}},{"html":"<p>The last time there was a coordinated effort to compile and standardize municipal zoning data in Massachusetts was in 1999, when the Massachusetts Bureau of Geographic Information (MassGIS) created a statewide GIS map of so-called 'base zoning' and compiled information from the bylaws or ordinances of each municipality in the state (with the exception of Boston).

The initial round of outreach demonstrated the wide variety of ways that municipalities store and share their zoning information. Some cities and towns publish their zoning district maps as a PDF map on their website; others publish it via an interactive web map; and a few make the GIS data available on their open data portal. Many municipalities employ a third-party consultant to develop, edit, and store their spatial data. In some cases, the only way to view a zoning map was by way of a paper copy accessible in town hall.</p>\n<p>The responsiveness of municipalities in response to our request for zoning data was uneven, at best. Despite our role as a regional agency, many municipalities were slow to respond or resistant to sharing their zoning data – and there is evidence that we received more favorable treatment than members of the general public. (A <a href=\"http://www-personal.umich.edu/~rgoodspe/papers/Goodspeed23_2_0.pdf\" class=\"report-section__link\">research effort</a> conducted in 2011 by former MAPC staffer Robert Goodspeed found that, in response to public records requests for digital zoning or parcel data, more than half of responding municipalities charged for the data, in some cases as much as $450). Many others provide it with questionable licensing or reuse restrictions, including extensive data use agreements and prohibitions on redistributing the data. Others simply refused to provide existing electronic copies of the data in response to the request, claiming they were exempt from public records law.</p>\n<p>We were also fortunate that MAPC works with the region's municipalities regularly on projects that require referencing municipal zoning data, and for those projects municipalities share their zoning shapefiles directly with us.</p>\n<p>Despite our best efforts, the Atlas still is missing up-to-date electronic zoning data for more than a dozen cities and towns. We were simply unable to gain access to data for ten municipalities, though we have reason to believe that updated spatial data exists. An additional six municipalities in the region have made changes to their zoning without corresponding updates to their GIS data. For these municipalities, the Atlas includes the boundaries published by MassGIS in 1999. Using these methods, we were able to create a mosaic of base zoning for all of the cities and towns in the MAPC region.</p>\n<p>Collecting spatial data for overlay districts adds additional complexity, as not every municipality has overlay districts, and some have many. We focused our efforts on collecting overlay districts that affect the allowed density of development, whether through allowances for higher density, or restrictions reducing it.</p>\n<p>To-date, we have collected overlay district spatial data from 56 municipalities on 260 overlay districts. We have supplemented these overlay districts with spatial data delineating 40R Smart Growth Zoning Overlay Districts, which were provided to MAPC by the Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) in March 2020. DHCD's 40R spatial data is current to 2017.

Before interpreting the code ourselves, we contacted municipal staff in each city and town to solicit their interpretation. That process entailed sending a table pre-populated with known districts, all desired fields, and attribute values from the 1999 MassGIS data, where available. For those municipalities that provided us with data, we used their interpretations as the basis for ours, and then augmented with a review of their most recent code. As with the collection of electronic zoning data, the municipal response to our request was spotty. Most of the fields were populated through MAPC interpretation.</p>\n<p>Each municipal zoning bylaw or ordinance, for the most part, covers the same basic information. Elements include allowed uses, multifamily allowances, setbacks, minimum lot size. But there is a wide range of ways the information is presented in the written zoning code, and variety in the specific form and use measures that are regulated. Some codes provide data tables that contain the same regulatory fields for each district in the municipality (see Image 1), while others provide a narrative description or bulleted list for each district (see Image 2). Meanwhile, some codes include regulations both in a table and as part of the narrative. Even the nomenclature varies: some codes present \"dimensional standards,\" others a \"schedule of dimensional requirements\" or a \"table of intensity regulations,\" and so forth. This variation in naming makes it difficult to even search for the relevant information in a zoning ordinance or bylaw.</p>\n<p>In addition to the variety of zoning code formats, there is a multiplicity of approaches to how development is regulated. For residential districts, some municipalities set forth a minimum lot size for each home or unit; others specify a maximum number of units per acre. Most municipalities establish certain requirements for setbacks, frontage, lot widths, and other dimensional measures. Even within a district, the effects of such requirements are not equal across all properties, since their relevance and application depends on lot shape and configuration. For example, setback requirements have a greater impact on narrow or irregularly shaped lots than on those that are more equilateral.</p>\n<p>For multifamily housing, mixed use, and commercial districts, the approaches are even more varied, often including some combination of height limits, lot coverage limits, open space requirements, setbacks, and (rarely) direct regulation of the floor area ratio (FAR). To add to the complexity, the way these metrics are calculated changes from municipality to municipality. Different codes present different methods for calculating percent lot coverage, height, applicable floor area, and so forth. Even the definition of something as basic as 'lot area' is nonstandard and may exclude wetlands and floodplains in some municipalities or districts but not in others.</p>\n<p>Complicating the patchwork of approaches and regulated metrics is the wide variety of exceptions or use-specific regulations. Some codes set different standards for an individual zone based on the proposed use (see Image 3). Others have specific requirements based on location for example, for parcels abutting another district, roadway type, or resource area. In some cases, dimensional requirements are a function of the proposal itself. They are based, for example, on FAR with respect to proposed height (see Image 4), or minimum lot area per unit with respect to number of units.</p>\n<p>These exceptions can be quite numerous and overlapping—in one case a single zone had no fewer than 58 footnotes describing specific exceptions or edge cases. There are also zoning standards such as minimum parking requirements that serve as a de facto limit on density even though they do not do so explicitly.</p>\n<p>Finally, the region's zoning codes are riddled with options that require discretionary approval by a designated authority, whether for a particular dimensional flexibility, use, parking requirement, or other standard. Again, the special permit requirements may only apply in particular cases within a zone, so determining what is permitted 'by right' is not even straightforward within a single zone for a single use. While this discretionary process is important to recognize because it influences a great deal of development that occurs in the region, it is so complex and unpredictable that it is not feasible for us to capture the many variations it adds to the data.</p>","id":"219e501c-b65a-56c0-aad8-0fb7e035ef3f","frontmatter":{"page":"report1","section":"collecting-and-interpreting-zoning-codes","title":"","order":10,"toc":null,"credit":null}},{"html":"<p>All these complexities demonstrate that the task of precisely determining what uses are permitted in a given zone and at what intensity is difficult, if not impossible. Nevertheless, the purpose of the initiative was to develop metrics comparable across all municipalities.</p>\n<p>For the purposes of our Zoning Atlas, therefore, MAPC defined a basic set of \"core fields\" covering use allowances and dimensional requirements and set out to collect that information from the zoning codes. Those core fields are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Minimum lot size</li>\n<li>Dwelling units allowed per acre</li>\n<li>Maximum height</li>\n<li>Maximum floor area ratio (FAR)</li>\n<li>Whether multifamily housing was a permitted use, and if a special permit was required</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For ordinances and bylaws that regulate development using different use and intensity metrics, we had to estimate the desired value based on other fields available in the code.

Where there were multiple uses or intensities allowed, our approach was to code districts according to the densest use allowable without a special permit, in order to provide an 'upper bound' estimate of by-right development potential.</p>\n<p>The challenges of interpreting overlay districts, especially those that permit greater flexibility and increased density, is even more complex than the task for base zoning. These districts often include even more requirements and discretionary review processes that tend to obscure, rather than define, the likely development potential on a given site. MAPC has not yet attempted to interpret or standardize the allowable uses and densities in these districts. For now, we have settled on classifying them into three types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Flexible Districts, which generally relax the density and dimensional requirements of the underlying zone. Examples include overlay zones that allow multifamily housing or mixed-use development in places where it is not permitted, or that permit flexibility in site design.</li>\n<li>Restrictive Districts, which limit development potential so as to protect natural resources or other assets. Examples include floodplain overlay districts and historical preservation districts</li>\n<li>Special Districts, which have targeted application to specific, often legally mandated uses.

Whether one is a developer, advocate, or regional planner, understanding what is permitted where and under what circumstances is an arduous task.</p>","id":"de30cb93-9091-5fed-9dc5-d1bcfa7d6510","frontmatter":{"page":"report1","section":"observations","title":"Observations","order":13,"toc":true,"credit":null}},{"html":"<p>Additionally, as municipalities update their codes, they often layer modifications over existing laws, creating a patchwork of rules and parameters that make interpretation even harder. Rarely do municipalities undertake a complete \"recodification\" of their zoning that would reconcile all the many overlapping modifications, redundancies, and conflicts.</p>\n<p>Another challenge to interpreting and standardizing municipal zoning codes is that there are many terms within the general land use lexicon that have no standard definition, and that municipalities may interpret differently. The terms multifamily, accessory dwelling unit, and percent lot coverage, for example, may refer to slightly different things in different municipalities. Most of the time municipalities will include a definitions section that explains specific terms, or will describe specifications in detail within the document, but there are cases in which these or similar terms are used without further explanation.</p>\n<p>This tangle is compounded by the wide variety of repositories and formats for zoning codes, ranging from PDF files or Microsoft Word documents posted on the municipal website to HTML pages hosted by third-party providers such as Municode. Some municipalities even post the zoning text as a scanned document, hampering users' ability to search, copy, or quote the code itself. The lack of standard formats and definitions for zoning codes renders local bylaws and ordinances largely inaccessible and opaque to those without abundant time to find and parse the zoning text.</p>\n<p>Whether by accident or intention, only a minority of municipalities publish their zoning in an electronic format that is readily accessible by taxpayers and other stakeholders. Ten municipalities gave no response to our request for spatial zoning data. As noted previously, Rob Goodspeed's research found that more than half of municipalities statewide charge for access to digital zoning or parcel data solicited through a public records request, sometimes more than $450.</p>\n<p>Goodspeed also found that many municipalities \"placed legal restrictions on the data through licensing that could chill or prohibit creative reuses of the information through emerging technologies.\" In extreme cases, municipalities refused to release existing data altogether, claiming that such digital data was exempt from public records requests, an assertion that has no basis in the law.</p>\n<p>Put simply, current practices with regard to municipal zoning generally run counter to the principles of government transparency and equitable engagement. They also provide unfair advantage to developers, attorneys, or realtors with inside knowledge and relationships, while disadvantaging those who have not previously worked in a given community. This is especially true for developers seeking to build much-needed workforce and affordable housing in suburban towns, where byzantine regulatory pathways stand between a proposal and a building permit. It's no wonder so many developers opt for a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Comprehensive_Permit_Act:_Chapter_40B\" class=\"report-section__link\">comprehensive permit</a> to build multifamily housing.</p>\n<p>The difficulties of gaining access to electronic zoning data also hinder the understanding of local zoning. Even as a regional public agency, we had trouble getting municipalities to provide data in a timely manner. Some never did so.</p>\n<p>Part of the challenge of accessing zoning data stems from the limited capacity of municipalities to maintain and publish electronic GIS records. Zoning changes, including the creation of new districts and the modification of existing district boundaries, are commonly authorized by changes to the text of the bylaw or ordinance itself. These changes must then be translated into new district boundaries on the zoning map itself, a task that may become an afterthought. In many cases, the available spatial data lags one or more revisions behind the code, if it is published at all. Six municipalities that have updated their zoning since 1999 did not make corresponding updates to their electronic zoning map. Additional barriers exist for those municipalities that don't even have direct access to their own zoning data, having outsourced the maintenance of the electronic records to consultants who may charge a fee for each change or record request.</p>\n<p>It doesn't help that most municipalities consider the paper zoning maps to be the \"official\" record of district boundaries, despite electronic zoning data offering far greater utility for municipal staff, project proponents, and resident stakeholders. This observation alone neatly summarizes the state of municipal zoning in Massachusetts today, which seems to emphasize historical precedent and discretionary decision-making over modern systems and predictability.</p>","id":"3b1f7c62-c77a-5ef3-a26e-3ef0d3981c0d","frontmatter":{"page":"report1","section":"observations","title":"","order":14,"toc":null,"credit":null}},{"html":"<p>The Zoning Atlas will always be a work in progress.

Code Structure and Standardization</h3>\n<p>Zoning district boundaries, even in electronic format, are only part of the puzzle. The regulatory information described in a municipality's zoning bylaws or ordinance fills in the details about what can or can't be built in any zone. Yet, extracting information from these documents can be very hard to do, depending on how the codes are structured. As we described earlier in this report, zoning codes vary widely in the way they are presented and the information they contain. This makes it difficult to produced standardized district information, even when all data are available. Some of the barriers could be overcome without making any substantive change to the zoning or publication method. For example, if there were a standard practice of presenting dimensional restrictions in a tabular format (rather than narrative), municipalities could make this change rather easily while providing great benefit to those seeking to find particular standards.</p>\n<p>Given the diversity of local contexts and strong sense of local autonomy throughout Massachusetts, it will require a considerable amount of political will to move to a system in which all municipal zoning adheres to a standardized format, making such a vision hard to achieve in the near future. However, it may be more feasible to establish a set of core attributes and encourage municipalities to report or estimate the equivalent values for each district. For example, if maximum dwelling units per acre were one such core attribute, then a municipality could report the value equivalent to their actual regulatory measure (such as 40,000 square feet minimum lot size for single family homes). Where a strict equivalent is not available, a municipality could provide an estimate, much as MAPC has done in this process. The difference, of course, is whether MAPC is making those calculations and assumptions, or a municipal staff person familiar with the details and applications of the subject district.</p>\n<p>Over time, the Commonwealth should consider the pros and cons of establishing standard definitions and structures for zoning bylaws, so that they are more readily comparable.
